## Contributing

If you find a bug, find something wrong with the documentation, or want to request a feature, you can do so by:

- Opening an issue or submitting a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Blupo/ColorPane/)
    - Pull requests must be submitted to the development branch
- Messaging [BlupoV2](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/blupov2/) via the DevForum
- Replying to the [main DevForum thread](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/1106112), although the previous methods are preferred

ColorPane uses [Rojo](https://rojo.space) for builds (`place.project.json` is used for development) and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme for documentation.

## Donations

ColorPane is and will remain a free-to-use, open-source project. Because of that, donations are greatly appreciated so that development can continue and new features can be added. If you want to support ColorPane by donating, you can use either:

- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Blupo) (for recurring donations), or
- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/Blupo) (for one-time donations)
