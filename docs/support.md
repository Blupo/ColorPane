### Feature Requests

Features should be requested by replying to the [DevForum thread](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/1106112). Feature requests should align with ColorPane's purpose of being a general-purpose suite of color tools. New features should be fully discussed before contributing any code to avoid any wasted time and/or effort.
