### Bug Reports

Bugs should be submitted by sending a report or opening an issue. Please include a detailed description and an image and/or video of the bug to make it easier to track down.

### Documentation

If you find any errors or places for improvement in the documentation, feel free to send a report (preferably via private message), open an issue, or submit a pull request ([`main`](https://github.com/Blupo/ColorPane/tree/main) or [`develop`](https://github.com/Blupo/ColorPane/tree/develop) is OK). ColorPane uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme for its documentation.

### Translations

To reach as many developers as possible, one of ColorPane's goals is to be fully translated into several languages. If you would like to help translate ColorPane, you can contribute to the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/colorpane).

### Feature Requests

Features requests should be submitted by sending them (preferable a private message) or opening an issue. Feature requests should align with ColorPane's purpose of being a general-purpose suite of color tools. Please be as detailed as possible, and include images and/or video if necessary. New features should be fully discussed before contributing any code to avoid any wasted time and/or effort.

### Code Contributions

If you have code you would like to contribute to ColorPane, please submit a pull request. ColorPane uses [Rojo 7](https://rojo.space) for project management. Please use `place.project.json` when working in Studio (`default.project.json` is used for building the plugin file). The plugin build folder will be located in ServerStorage.

**Please only submit new code to the [`develop` branch](https://github.com/Blupo/ColorPane/tree/develop).**
