# ColorPane

ColorPane is a suite of color tools for designing Roblox games. Included in this plugin are:

- A color editor with a color wheel, several types of sliders, and various color palettes, with the ability to create, import, and export your own palettes.
- A gradient editor, similar to the Studio editor, with some quality-of-life changes including keypoint snapping, buttons to swap keypoint colors around, and a gradient palette.
- A Color Properties panel, which lets you use the color picker and gradient editor to edit the colors of parts, UIs, or other objects in your games.
