# ColorPane

ColorPane is a suite of color tools for Roblox Studio plugins. Some of the tools included are:

- A color editor with a color wheel, several types of sliders, and various color palettes, with the ability to create, import, and export your own palettes.
- A gradient editor, similar to the Studio editor, with some quality-of-life changes including keypoint snapping, buttons to swap keypoint colors around, and a gradient palette.
