This page explains the various options in the Settings window, in the order that they appear.

## ColorPane Settings

These settings apply to all instances of ColorPane.

- *Name palettes before creating them*: If enabled, you will have the opportunity to change a palette's name *before* you create it. If not, you can only do that *after* the palette is created.
- *Gradient keypoint snap %*: The [gradient editor's](gradient-editor.md) keypoint snap value.

## Companion Settings

These settings only apply to the Companion plugin itself.

- *Automatically load the Roblox API data for Color Properties on startup*: Used in [Color Properties](color-properties.md). If enabled, the plugin will automatically load Roblox API data, which lets you use Color Properties without having to manually activate it.
- *Cache Roblox API data for use during testing sessions*: Used in Color Properties. If enabled, Roblox API data will be saved to plugin settings, which lets you use Color Properties while testing your games.
