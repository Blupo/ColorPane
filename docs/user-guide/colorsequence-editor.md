![The ColorSequence editor](../images/colorsequence-editor.png)

## Adding and Removing Keypoints

You can add a new keypoint by clicking on the empty space in the gradient view, as long as your cursor isn't snapped to another keypoint and you haven't reached the keypoint limit.

You can remove a keypoint by selecting it and pressing the ![minus](../images/minus.png) button, or you can right-click on it (without having to select it). 

## Editing Keypoints

Keypoints can be moved by dragging them around, or you can edit their progress value with the text box next to the *Color* button. The first and last keypoints are fixed and cannot be moved around.

To change a keypoint's color, use the *Color* button that appears after you select it.

When a keypoint is selected you can also use the ![left](../images/left.png) and ![right](../images/right.png) buttons to swap the color of the selected keypoint with the color of the previous or next keypoint, respectively.

## Other Functions

- The ![reverse](../images/reverse.png) button will flip the ColorSequence.
- The *Reset* button will reset the ColorSequence to its starting value.
- You can edit what progress values will snap to using the *Snap* text box. Snap values can range between 0.001% and 25%.
