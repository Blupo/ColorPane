The Color Properties window allows you to view and edit the color properties of objects using ColorPane's editors. You can toggle the window using the associated button in the toolbar.

By default, the window will not be activated, since the Roblox API data is not loaded in by default. You will need to click the *Load* button and wait for the data to load.

!!! info
    Loading the Roblox API data requires an HTTP request, and you will be prompted to allow this if this is the first time you're loading the data.

If you want the window to automatically load at startup, you can either toggle the option below the *Load* button or toggle the option in the Settings window.
