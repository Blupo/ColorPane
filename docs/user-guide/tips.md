# Tips and Tricks

## Color Editor

### Page Pickers

- On the Slider and Palette sections, you can use the scroll wheel with the mouse hovering over the dropdown button to quickly switch between pages.

### Palettes

- If you have a color selected, you can use the ++up++, ++down++, ++left++, or ++right++ keys to select a different color, and you can hold down the key to change selections faster.
- You can skip the confirmation screen to delete a palette if you hold down the ++shift++ key before you click the *Delete* option.
- If you prefer to name palettes *after* you create them, there is an option in the [Settings](settings.md) that lets you create palettes without naming them. They will have the default name *New Palette*.

## Gradient Editor

- If you have a keypoint selected, you can use the ++left++ or ++right++ arrow keys to select a different keypoint.
- You can right-click on a keypoint to delete it instead of having to use the <span class="cp-button">:material-trash-can-outline:</span> button.
