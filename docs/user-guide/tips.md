## Color Editor

### Page Pickers

- On the Slider and Palette sections, you can use the scroll wheel on the dropdown to quickly switch between pages.

### Palettes

- If you have a color selected, you can use the arrow keys to select a different color, and you can hold down the key to select faster.
- You can skip the confirmation screen to delete a palette if you hold down the Shift key before you use the delete option.
- If you prefer to name palettes *after* you create them, there is an option in the Settings that lets you create palettes without naming them. They will have the default name *New Palette*.

## Gradient Editor

- If you have a keypoint selected, you can use the left and right arrow keys to select a different keypoint.
- You can right-click on a keypoint to delete it instead of having to use the dedicated delete button.

## Resetting Session Lock (TENTATIVE)

In some cases where ColorPane can't clear the session lock (usually because of an error during execution), new sessions won't be able to save any changes to settings and you'll see a warning in the output about this. In this case, you can use the *Release Session Lock* button at the bottom of the Settings so that the session lock can be claimed by another session.

The session lock will be claimed by the first session that attempts to save data, which may *not necessarily* be the session you used to release the lock, if there are multiple sessions open.
