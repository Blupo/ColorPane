# ColorPane

![Color Editor](docs/images/color-editor.png)

ColorPane is a suite of color tools for designing Roblox games. Included in this plugin are:

- A color editor with a color wheel, several types of sliders, and various color palettes, with the ability to create, import, and export your own palettes.
- A gradient editor, similar to the Studio editor, with some quality-of-life changes including keypoint snapping, buttons to swap keypoint colors around, and a gradient palette.
- A Color Properties panel, which lets you use the color picker and gradient editor to edit the colors of parts, UIs, or other objects in your games.

ColorPane also has an API that allows you to use these tools in your own plugins so that you don't have to create them yourself.

ColorPane is available in the plugin library [here](https://roblox.com/library/6474565567/ColorPane). You can also grab a [release](https://github.com/Blupo/ColorPane/releases) from GitHub and install it manually.
